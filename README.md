# Pokemon

The Pokémon App is a mobile application built using React Native that allows users to browse, search, and view detailed information about Pokémon. It integrates with the public PokéAPI (https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/) to fetch real-time Pokémon data including names, types, stats, abilities, and images. The app is designed to be responsive, user-friendly, and visually engaging for Pokémon fans and developers alike.

## Installation


# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see Pokemon app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.
